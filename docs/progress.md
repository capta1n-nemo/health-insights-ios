### Insights
- [x] Readiness / Recovery — HRV, resting HR, sleep, temperature, respiration
      vs. personal baseline (EWMA + z-scores).
- [x] Heart Health — VO₂max, resting HR, HRV vs. age/sex norms + baseline.
- [x] Cardiovascular risk — combined SCORE2 + ASCVD, consensus + range.
- [x] Blood Pressure — grounding-first cuff logging, two-feature experimental
      estimator, AHA category bands, mean arterial pressure, 30-day grounding
      window, full metric-detail-screen migration.
- [x] Substance Impact — private logging + before/after HR/HRV/temp/sleep +
      cumulative cardiovascular-load indicator + safety flag.
- [x] Sleep quality, cardio fitness trend, body composition, resting-HR trend.
- [x] Heart & fitness age — vascular age by inverting SCORE2/ASCVD against an
      optimal-factor reference person (consensus + range, each engine bounded by
      its own validated band), fitness age by inverting the VO₂max norm line, and
      risk projected at future ages the equations *are* validated for instead of
      a fabricated lifetime figure.
- [x] Fitness trajectory — VO₂max slope read against the age-typical decline
      (holding level is a gain), 12-month projection with its residual spread,
      and "what would move it" levers drawn from the user's own busier-versus-
      lighter weeks before any general evidence.
- [x] Vitals Check (Today card) — every sensed vital judged against the personal
      baseline, reporting outliers rather than averaging them away, with absolute
      clinical bounds overriding a permissive personal baseline. Gave heart rate,
      walking heart rate, blood oxygen and body temperature their first reader.
- [x] Every canonical vital now has at least one reader, and
      `docs/architecture.md` carries the metric → insight table so a future gap
      is visible. Readiness gained blood oxygen; Sleep Quality gained overnight
      blood oxygen and skin temperature; Body Composition gained lean/muscle/bone
      mass, body water and a fat-loss-versus-muscle-loss narrative; Heart Age
      reports Oura's vascular age beside its own. Only `dayStrain` is unread —
      Whoop isn't connected.

### Insight detail screens
- [x] Score over time on every scored card — replayed from raw samples so it's
      useful on first launch, and recorded going forward so a scoring change
      can't rewrite what the user was actually told.
- [x] One overlay of *every* metric behind a card, z-scored onto a shared axis
      (a log axis was tried on paper and rejected: it doesn't equalise), with a
      raw/log toggle, a validated eight-hue metric palette, and a legend that
      names each series and flags the ones with no data.
- [x] The chart's series are emitted by the scoring code itself
      (`InsightResult.contributors`), so adding an input to a score adds a line
      with no second edit — replacing a hand-written per-insight metric switch
      that had silently drifted.
- [x] Derived patterns: divergence ("more sleep, but blood oxygen is drifting
      down"), day-to-day co-movement, and which input tracks the score — all
      behind sample-count and effect-size floors, and always worded as
      associations rather than causes.

### Vitals Check, rebuilt so 100 means something
- [x] Real baselines: the day's representative value per source over a 28-day
      window, replacing `suffix(60)` — sixty *readings*, which for heart rate was
      the last five hours and moved with the very thing it was meant to detect.
- [x] Freshness: `now` is finally used, stale vitals are named and counted
      against coverage instead of silently reading as "measured today".
- [x] Continuous, direction-aware normality replacing a step function, aggregated
      worst-first and capped by coverage — so a perfect score needs everything
      you normally record measured today *and* sitting on its baseline.
- [x] Sources de-duplicated and scored separately, so two miscalibrated devices
      no longer size the standard deviation between them.
- [x] Corrected bounds, plus an HRV relative floor for the slow collapse a
      rolling z-score cannot see.
- [x] Scan widened from 7 metrics to 17: HRV SDNN (the HRV Apple Watch actually
      records), blood pressure, skin temperature, blood glucose, perfusion index,
      AFib burden, heart-rate recovery, walking steadiness and asymmetry.
- [x] Apple's own event flags read as events, not metrics — irregular rhythm,
      high/low heart rate, low cardio fitness, unsteady walking.

### Insights tab: the deep dive
- [x] Lagged correlation — a signal at day *d* against the score at *d+1…d+3*,
      reported only when it beats same-day. The one question Today can't ask.
- [x] Long-horizon score history with a fitted trend and its residual spread.
- [x] Cross-insight score comparison — all 0–100, so directly comparable.
- [x] Rolling 28 days vs the prior 28, standardised by the prior spread.
- [x] `contributors` filled for the trend models, so their charts carry honest
      weights rather than falling back to the declared candidate list.

### Creative data use
- [x] Temperature reconstruction from wearable nightly-deviation readings.
- [x] Blood-test photo import (on-device OCR → confirmed grounding values).

### Integrations
- [x] Apple Health (live, on-device).
- [x] Oura, Whoop, Withings — on-device OAuth, BYO developer credentials,
      Keychain storage, no backend.
- [x] "Other data" browser — imports every HealthKit/provider field, not just
      the metrics the app has a first-class insight for. Renders text and boolean
      values, tallies categorical states, and charts only numeric series.
- [x] Provider-agnostic ingestion pipeline — `RawValue` (number/text/flag),
      recursive `JSONFlattener` with array summarisation and audited skips,
      `EnvelopeSpec`-driven ingestors, a persisted `FieldCatalogue` that makes a
      provider's schema change a logged event, and data-driven `PromotionRuleSet`
      mapping to canonical vitals. A new connector is a declaration, not a parser.
- [x] Oura's undocumented `stress` and `heart_health` scopes — resilience,
      cardiovascular age and VO₂ Max reachable for the first time. Console URL
      updated to `developer.ouraring.com`.
- [x] Diagnostics that can actually diagnose: provider error bodies (RFC7807
      `detail` + `x-trace-id`) captured with a per-status remedy, granted scopes
      recorded and re-stated each sync, refresh-and-retry-once on a 401 (skipped
      for scope failures), per-collection record counts, and a per-metric,
      per-source import breakdown. Expandable detail in Troubleshooting plus a
      Share action.

### App structure
- [x] Four-tab layout: Today / Vitals / Insights / Settings.
- [x] Multi-source overlay charts with provenance badges (direct API vs.
      Apple Health bridge vs. Apple Watch).
- [x] Adjustable timeframe (D/W/M/6M/Y/All) with correct chart scaling at every
      zoom level (the "All squashes into a strip" bug is fixed).
- [x] Chart lines break on data gaps instead of bridging them; long ranges are
      bucketed (mean/median/sum per the metric) instead of raw-decimated.
- [x] Active/inactive source handling — a source that's gone quiet is shown as
      history, excluded from the current average.
- [x] Per-category metric layouts (trend/range/total/bivariate/static) via
      `MetricViewStrategy`, replacing one generic screen for every metric shape.
- [x] Height (and future static attributes) get a plain value card, no chart.
- [x] Feedback ledger + privacy-preserving telemetry outbox.
- [x] Troubleshooting view (per-integration/per-metric sync diagnostics).

### CI/CD
- [x] GitHub Actions CI on a self-hosted Mac runner: `swift test` + unsigned
      app compile on every push.
- [x] Wi-Fi deploy to a pinned iPhone via `devicectl` on push to `main`.
- [x] Incremental deploy builds (no forced `clean`) for faster iteration.
- [x] Build-provenance stamp in Settings ▸ About (commit + build number).

### Developer workflow
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` + memory router, `.claude/settings.json` permissions, and a
      `/handover` slash command for cross-session continuity.
- [x] Verified `/handover` and `CLAUDE.md` auto-load when the session's working
      directory *is* this repo — both fired in the session that shipped the age
      insights. Attaching this repo alongside a different working directory is
      still the failure mode (see `activeContext.md`).
- [x] Push-straight-to-`main` recorded as overriding the web harness's
      branch-and-draft-PR default, with the reason (`deploy.yml` only fires on a
      push to `main`, so a PR installs nothing) in `CLAUDE.md` and
      `docs/deployment.md`.
- [x] `swift test` rule reconciled with reality: agent sandboxes have no Swift
      toolchain, so the rule is attempt-it, say plainly when it can't run, and
      treat the CI run on the push as the gate.

## In progress / not yet device-verified
- [ ] On-device walkthrough of the latest nine-part UI pass (CI-green, not yet
      manually confirmed on the phone) — see `activeContext.md`.
- [ ] Heart & fitness age and Fitness trajectory on the phone: both are new cards
      on the Insights tab. Worth checking the three-age comparison row renders on
      the narrowest device, and that a profile with no blood pressure shows the
      fitness half alone rather than an empty card.
- [ ] The ingestion pipeline and Vitals Check on the phone — see
      `activeContext.md` for the specific things to look at, including that the
      Oura setup screen no longer raises the "Paste from your Mac?" prompt.

### More "gap-filling" insights
Listed cheapest-first — the second one can't start without new plumbing.

- [ ] Cardio strain from stimulants as a first-class trend. The before/after
      analysis and the 14-day load figure already exist in
      `SubstanceResponseAnalyzer`; what's missing is a decaying daily load
      *series* to trend and chart.
- [ ] Sleep-debt and circadian consistency from bedtime variance. **Blocked on a
      new signal**: no provider currently gives us a bedtime. Apple Health and
      Oura both stamp `sleepDurationHours` at the *start of the calendar day*, so
      sleep-onset time would need its own `MetricType` (a clock-hour value, with
      circular statistics — the mean of 23:30 and 00:30 is midnight, not noon)
      plus parser work in all three providers.

### Integrations
- [ ] Explain why Oura's API serves only ~4–6 months of history against years of
      ring data mirrored through Apple Health. No `next_token`, byte counts match
      record counts, so it isn't client-side truncation. Offered, not yet taken up.
- [ ] Oura pagination (`next_token`) — logged as a warning when it appears, which
      it hasn't yet. Implement on first sighting, not before.
- [ ] Oura's `heartrate` endpoint is never called despite the scope being
      requested; direct Oura contributes no heart-rate samples.
- [ ] Hume Band direct API (today flows in via Apple Health only).
- [ ] Ultrahuman, Garmin, Fitbit — drop in via `HealthIntegration` protocol.

### Unstructured data
- [ ] Live document scanner (VisionKit) instead of library-only picking.
- [ ] Foundation Models structured extraction for arbitrary lab analytes.
- [ ] ECG photo/PDF import with metadata (no automated interpretation — that's
      a regulated medical-device claim, out of scope by design).

### Charts
- [ ] Filled `AreaMark` min/max bands (currently shipped as outlined
      `LineMark` pairs — a deliberate, pre-approved fallback for a Swift Charts
      SDK hazard; revisit only with a dedicated compile-spike).

### On-device ML
- [ ] Core ML personal anomaly detection once enough history exists.

## Guardrails (unchanging)
- Not a medical device; not medical advice. Substance features are
  harm-reduction and descriptive, never encouragement or dosing guidance.
- Health data stays on-device; the only network calls are the user's own
  wearable APIs. No health data on any server.
